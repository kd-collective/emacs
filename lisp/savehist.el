;;; Commentary:

;; Many editors (e.g. Vim) have the feature of saving minibuffer
;; history to an external file after exit.  This package provides the
;; same feature in Emacs.  When set up, it saves recorded minibuffer
;; histories to a file (`~/.emacs.d/history' by default).  Additional
;; variables may be specified by customizing
;; `savehist-additional-variables'.

;; To use savehist, turn on savehist-mode by putting the following in
;; `~/.emacs':
;;
;;     (savehist-mode 1)
;;
;; or with customize: `M-x customize-option RET savehist-mode RET'.
;;
;; You can also explicitly save history with `M-x savehist-save' and
;; load it by loading the `savehist-file' with `M-x load-file'.

MAX-SIZE elements (if the value is a list) before saving the value.

  "Toggle saving of minibuffer history (Savehist mode).

When Savehist mode is enabled, minibuffer history is saved
to `savehist-file' periodically and when exiting Emacs.  When
Savehist mode is enabled for the first time in an Emacs session,
it loads the previous minibuffer histories from `savehist-file'.
The variable `savehist-autosave-interval' controls the
periodicity of saving minibuffer histories.

If `savehist-save-minibuffer-history' is non-nil (the default),
all recorded minibuffer histories will be saved.  You can arrange
for additional history variables to be saved and restored by
customizing `savehist-additional-variables', which by default is
an empty list.  For example, to save the history of commands
invoked via \\[execute-extended-command], add `command-history' to the list in
`savehist-additional-variables'.

Alternatively, you could customize `savehist-save-minibuffer-history'
to nil, and add to `savehist-additional-variables' only those
history variables you want to save.

To ignore some history variables, add their symbols to the list
in `savehist-ignored-variables'.

This mode should normally be turned on from your Emacs init file.
Calling it at any other time replaces your current minibuffer
histories, which is probably undesirable."
